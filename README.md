<h1 align=center>GTA: San Andreas - Nintendo Switch port</h1>

This is a wrapper/port of the Android version of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas
(**v2.11.311**, arm64-v8a). It loads the original game binary, patches it and
runs it. It's basically a minimalist Android environment in which we natively
run the original 64-bit Android binary as-is.

### How to install

You're going to need:
* the **arm64-v8a** `.apk` (and `.obb`) for version **2.11.311**.

To install:
1. Create a folder called `gtasa` in the `switch` folder on your SD card.
2. From the **arm64-v8a** APK, extract these two native libraries to
   `/switch/gtasa/`:
   * `lib/arm64-v8a/libGame.so`
   * `lib/arm64-v8a/libc++_shared.so`
3. Extract the **game data** so the files sit loose under `/switch/gtasa/`,
   preserving their directory structure:
   * everything under the APK's `assets/` folder, **and**
   * the contents of the OBB (`main.*.obb` — it is just a ZIP; the `data/`,
     `models/`, `texdb/`, `audio/`, `text/`, `anim/`, `es2/`, … trees inside it
     go directly in `/switch/gtasa/`).
4. Copy `gtasa_nx.nro` and `controls.txt` into `/switch/gtasa/`.

Your SD card should end up with at least `/switch/gtasa/gtasa_nx.nro`,
`/switch/gtasa/libGame.so`, `/switch/gtasa/libc++_shared.so`, and the extracted
game data folders (`data/`, `models/`, `texdb/`, `audio/`, …) all inside
`/switch/gtasa/`.

### Notes

Low Performance : CPU-bound on draw calls, the game issues a lot of GL calls per frame and Switch mesa driver is slow per-call and the GPU sits idle most of the time 
Best lever today is CPU overclock a real fix would need a thinner/threaded GL driver

This will not work in applet/album mode (it needs the full memory + syscall set).
Launch it through a **game override** (hold R on an installed title) or a
forwarder.

Save games and settings are stored in `/switch/gtasa/`.

The port has a config file at `/switch/gtasa/config.txt`, created on first run:
* `screen_width` / `screen_height` — render resolution; `-1` picks 1280x720 in
  handheld and 1920x1080 docked
* `trilinear_filter` — `1` forces trilinear texture filtering
* `show_fps` — `1` draws a small FPS counter in the top-left corner

### How to build

You're going to need devkitA64 and the following packages/libraries:
* `switch-mesa`
* `switch-libdrm_nouveau`
* `switch-sdl2`
* `switch-mpg123`
* `switch-ffmpeg`
* `switch-openal-soft`
* `devkitpro-pkgbuild-helpers`

Then run `make` (with `DEVKITPRO` set in the environment).
